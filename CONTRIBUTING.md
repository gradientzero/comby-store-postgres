## Development Workflow
We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) for collaboration. All changes happen through pull requests (PRs). In the early stages, changes are driven directly by us, but changes should typically be reflected through PRs.

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork locally.
2. Create a new branch from **master**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature-or-issue-id
```
3. Make your changes:
- Add tests for any new functionality.
- Update documentation if APIs or behaviors change.
4. Ensure the following before submitting:
- Your code passes the test suite.
- Your code adheres to the project's coding style.
5. Open a pull request (PR) and describe your changes clearly.

We actively welcome and review pull requests, so donâ€™t hesitate to contribute!


## Reporting Bugs
We use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. To report a bug:

1. Search existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
2. If no similar issue exists, open a new issue with:
    - A clear and descriptive title.
    - Steps to reproduce the issue:
        - Include sample code if possible.
        - Be specific (e.g., system version, inputs, outputs).
    - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
    - Additional context, logs, or screenshots to help us diagnose the issue.

Please use the templates provided in the **.github** directory.
Thorough bug reports help us fix issues faster. Thank you!
